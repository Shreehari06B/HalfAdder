# Half Adder - Logic Circuit Project

A **Half Adder** is a basic circuit in electronics.  
It takes two binary inputs and produces:
- **Sum** (A ⊕ B)
- **Carry** (A · B)

This project was created using **Logic Circuit Simulator Pro** on Android.

## 🧮 Truth Table - Half Adder

| A | B | Sum (A ⊕ B) | Carry (A · B) |
|---|---|--------------|----------------|
| 0 | 0 |      0       |       0        |
| 0 | 1 |      1       |       0        |
| 1 | 0 |      1       |       0        |
| 1 | 1 |      0       |       1        |

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Logic Circuit Simulator Pro (Android app)

## 💡 How it works

The Half Adder adds two 1-bit inputs. The **Sum** is calculated using an XOR gate, and the **Carry** using an AND gate. The circuit is built using drag-and-drop logic gates in the app.
